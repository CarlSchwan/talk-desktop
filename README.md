# Nextcloud Talk for Desktop/Mobile Linux

Nextcloud Talk is a fully on-premises audio/video and chat communication service. It features web and mobile apps and is designed to offer the highest degree of security while being easy to use.

Nextcloud Talk lowers the barrier for communication and lets your team connect any time, any where, on any device, with each other, customers or partners.

## Scope

This client for Nextcloud Talk is a hobby project in development and currently in an alpha stage. The goal is to have a native desktop and Plasma Mobile client using Kirigami, a convergent framework developed by the KDE Community.

Due to the earlier development stage, plus refrain from sending bug reports. Code contributions however are very welcome!
